tunebank-frontend-for-node
==========================


This is the browser frontend code for [tunebank-node](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/tunebank-node) - i.e. it is a (small) rewrite of [tunebank-frontend](https://github.com/newlandsvalley/tunebank-frontend) allowing it to operate against the node backend rather than against the `musicrest` server whilst attempting to keep the look-and-feel just about the same.

To Build
--------

    npm run build

To Test
-------

    fire up a tunebank-node development server then:

    npm run test
